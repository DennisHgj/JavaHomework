Within the `comp1110.homework.J04` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `ShoeSize`, that will estimate your shoe size
by reading in your height (in meters) from the console,
multiplying by 5.0, rounding it to the nearest integer
(rounding up on ties), and printing the result. Test your
program using the `J04` test.

 Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
