Within the `comp1110.homework.J13` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Mean` that will create an `ArrayList` of `Double`, reading
`double`s from the console into it, each on a separate line (until the user
types `ctrl-D`, by pressing the control and `D` keys, (`ctrl-Z` on Windows),
to indicate the end of the list), and calculate and print the arithmetic mean
of the numbers in this list.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
