Within the `comp1110.homework.J03` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Square`. The class will read from the console an
integer that represents the length of a side and then calculate
 and print an integer that reprents the area of a square. Test
 your solution using the `J03` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
