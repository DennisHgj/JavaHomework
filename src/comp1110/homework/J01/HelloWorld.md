You will be asked to answer the following question:

* Within the `comp1110.homework.J01` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
  create a class a called `HelloWorld` (you should add the file to git when prompted).
This should appear as a file `HelloWorld` within a package `comp1110.homework`.
This detail is important because the tests assume that your work appears in
exactly this location.
* Force JUnit to be added to your project's classpath if it is not already.  Place your cursor within
your `HelloWorld` class, and type `Ctrl+Shift+T` (or `Navigate` -> `Test`).
This should bring up the `Create Test` dialogue.  From the `Testing library:`
drop-down, select `Junit4`.   Use the `Fix` button to add Junit to your module.
In the next dialogue, stick with the default to use the library in the IntelliJ
distribution, and press OK.  You can then press `Cancel` at the bottom of the
`Create Test` dialogue (you don't actually need to create a test, you just want
to add Junit to your path).
* Navigate to your `HelloWorld` class, and modify it so that its main
 method prints `Hello world!`.
* Test your `HelloWorld` class by selecting the `J01` option in the
  drop-down next to green arrow.
* Once your `HelloWorld` class passes the tests, commit it to your git repo.
