Within the `comp1110.homework.J01` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Greet` that reads in from the console a string, and then outputs
a greeting `Hi ...!`, where the name replaces the elipses. e.g. If the input
is `Hugh` then your output should be `Hi Hugh!`. Test your solution using
 the `J01` test.

 Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
