Within the `comp1110.homework.J01` package of the `comp1110-homework`
project, create a class `NumberWord` that reads in from the console a
string and an integer and then outputs the integer followed a comma, a
space, and then the string  e.g. If the input is `Wow` and `10` then your
output should be `10, Wow`. Test your solution using the `J01` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
