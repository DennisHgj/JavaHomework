This question has two parts.

First, within the `comp1110.homework.O04` package of the `comp1110-homework` project, create a
class, `Sum` that extends an `ArrayList` of `Integer` by adding a public method,
`int sum()` that returns the sum of all elements in the list of Integers (add the elements
up each time the method is called).

Second, once you have the above working properly, *enhance* the solution such that the sum is *stored* and maintained as a public
instance field of `Sum` (the field is public ). *Instead of recalculating* the total each time the `sum()` method is called, it should just be able to
*return the value of the sum field*. To do this, you'll need to adjust the value of your sum field each time
the contents of the array list change.  Note that in order to do this correctly, many
of the standard methods of the `ArrayList` class must be overwritten so that they are able
to adjust the sum as elements are added or removed from the list. For this question you
need only override the four 'add' methods:
* `boolean add(Integer i)`,
* `void add(int index, Integer i)`,
* `boolean addAll(Collection<? extends Integer> c)`, and
* `boolean addAll(int index, Collection<? extends Integer> c)`.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
