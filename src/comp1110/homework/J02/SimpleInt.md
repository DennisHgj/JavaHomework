Within the `comp1110.homework.J02` package of the `comp1110-homework`
project, create a class `SimpleInt` that does the following steps:
* it declares an integer, `i` and initializes it to zero
* it  prints out `i` (using `system.out.println()`)
* it adds `3` to `i`
* it prints out `i`
* it multiplies `i` by `2`
* it prints out `i`
* it divides `i` by `3`
* it prints out `i`

Test your solution using the `J02` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
