Within the `comp1110.homework.J02` package of the `comp1110-homework`
project, create a class `SimpleString` that does the following steps:
* it declares an String, `s` and initializes it to empty string (`''`)
* it  prints out `s` (using `system.out.println()`)
* it assigns `"Foo"` to `s` (use the `=` sign for assignment)
* it prints out `s`
* it assigns `"Bar"` to `s`
* it prints out `s`
* it concatenates a `"!"` to the end of `s` (use the `+` symbol for string concatenation)
* it prints out `s`

Test your solution using the `J02` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
