Within the `comp1110.homework.J06` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Prime` that reads a positive integer from the console and
then prints all of the prime numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), one on each line.
Test your solution using the `J06` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
