Within the `comp1110.homework.J06` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Permute` that reads in two strings one line after the other from
the console then determines whether the characters of one string are some
permutation of the characters of another string (a permutation is a strict
reordering, no additions, no deletions). The strings will be made up only of
lower case letters and not contain white spaces (e.g. tab, space character). If
the strings are perumtations of each other, print `Yes` otherwise print `No`.
So for exampl `cats` is a permutation of `acst`, so you would print `Yes` whereas,
neither `cats` nor `catt` are permutations of `cate`, so you would print `No`
(Hint - use `.length` to find the length of a `String` and the `charAt()`
method to get the character at a given position in a `String`). Test your solution
using the `J06` test.

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
