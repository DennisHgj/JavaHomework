Within the `comp1110.homework.J14` package of the `comp1110-homework` project,
create a class `Cost`, that tracks the cost of items. Within `Cost`, create a
public inner (non-static) class, `Item`, that includes the following:
~~~~
public class Item {
    String name;
    int cost;   // in cents
    public Item(String n, int c) {
        name = n;
        cost = c;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return name + " " + cost;
    }
}
~~~~

* Modify your inner Item class so that it implements the `Comparable<Item>` interface.
Items should be ordered based on the cost (lowest cost first). If two items cost the
same amount then order these items alphabetically based on their name.
* Add an instance data structure (`HashMap<String, Item>`) to your `Cost` class for
storing items, using the item's name as the key.
* Add an instance method `void addItem(String name, int cost)` to your `Cost` class that
allows new items to be added, and a method `printCost()` that prints out all items sorted
in the order described above, one item per line, with a single space separating the item
name and its cost.
* Suppose you are given a gift voucher for the above shop. Assume that the shop does not
give change on gift vouchers, and you do not wish to spend any more than what is in the
gift voucher. Add an instance method `int voucherWaste(int value)` to `Cost` which will
return the difference between the value of the voucher (in cents) and what could be spent
given the set of items in the shop. e.g. Say you had a voucher for $100 and the items in
the shop were worth: $87, $20, $99, $12, then the most you could spend would be the full
$100 (just buy 5 of the $20 item) so there would be zero waste, whereas, if the items in
the shop were worth: $87, $22, $30, $45 then the most you could spend would be $97
(remember that your method will express the voucher and the costs in the same units, cents).

Once you have it working, add and commit your work.
