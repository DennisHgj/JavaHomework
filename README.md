### Purpose

These homework exercises are designed to help you learn.   You may do them at
your own pace.   The exercises are not marked, but you are welcome to ask
your tutor for help during your scheduled lab sessions.

The exercises form the basis for the two lab exams, each of which will be
composed of questions randomly drawn from the homework set.

### Running tests

To run the tests for a given unit (such as 'J01'), go to the small drop-down
menu next to the small green 'run' arrow at the upper right of your IntelliJ
window.   Use the drop-down to select the relevant unit and the relevant tests
will run.

### Updating

The homework exercises may be updated during the semester.   If so, an annoucement
will be made.  To see the updates you should do an 'upstream pull' (explained in [lab 2](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-labs/blob/master/src/comp1110/lab2/README.md#gitlab-task)) on this repo.
